         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE SECOND PART OF THE <hi>Ignoramus Iuſtices:</hi> OR An ANSWER to the Scandalous SPEECH OF <hi>Sir W. S. Barronet.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Will not ong ltrouble the Courtious Reader with a difcription of the Perſon that made this learned Speech, which is Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> And the very ſame Sir <hi>Wm.,</hi> which heretofore (as I am informed) in the late troubles was called Col. <hi>S.</hi> And though I love not to rake in Dunghills, or into the lives and actions of men, at any time, much leſs after ſo long an intervale; yet becauſe he himſelf hath been pleaſed to make the world ſo happy not only in the publication of that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpeech, but alſo told us in <hi>p.</hi> 4. that he feels the ſmart of <hi>Goldſmith's</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60490:3"/>and <hi>Haberdaſhers Hall</hi> to this day, it may not therefore be amis a little to give him a hint of his Piety, when he was in the Station of a Souldier, that as in a looking-glaſs he may view himſelf now being a Juſtice (and as this is done as well to inform the world of the perſon and his zeal, for the cauſe of God in times paſt, as now he pretends by his ſpeech both for the cauſe of God and his <hi>R. H.</hi> for time to come, ſo learnedly interwoven with Scripture Phraſes, and larded with ſuch Sentenſes of Elegant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.) If this be the ſame <hi>S.</hi> that was called Col. <hi>S.</hi> in the late troubles he may remember and bleſs God for his great Converſion ſince that time; and if it be not painted Piety, that he now makes the world believe he hath, then he above all men, hath the greateſt reaſon in the world to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the free grace of God in converting his bloudy heart; for in thoſe dayes, and in cool of bloud too, in the County of Bucks, he like as wicked <hi>Haman</hi> did againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> gave this Councel to kill and deſtroy all the Gentlemen, Yeomen, Farmers, their wives and Children, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard either to Sex, Age, or condition, in that Country; for fear that there being many in that County, as he believed would be of the other ſide, when they had an opportunity, and ſhould take part againſt them. Now if this be the ſame man, his nature is mightily altered, for now his gaul goes no further, but that the Diſſenters Purſes ſhould pay that ſhot he has ſo elegantly manifeſted, and if the ſtanders by did not miſtake his words, he both ſpeak and meant that the Diſſenters ſhould be proſecuted for their money, to help pay the charge the King had been out, in the war with <hi>Argier,</hi> &amp;c. and the building the 30 Ships, to ſave the Parliament a labour, which was a moſt ingenious Contrivance; but more of that in its due place; But whether this be the ſame Coll. <hi>S.</hi> or not; yet I am fully aſured this is the very ſame Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> that the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter Parliament,</hi> was had before the Committee for ſtoping, and hindring Petitioning the King, for calling of Parliaments, and therein abuſing that law, he hath ſince owned by his late Abhorrencies, who was then heard to ſay, that he was falſely accuſed, for that he was ſo far, (good man) from offering any ſuch violence to the Rights of the people, and Parliaments, that he proteſted his innocency with much more aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, then now in his grand ſpeech, he doth his ſincerity of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the King and the Laws, yet at that time, true evidence tells us, that the very ſame day, he made that ſo ſolemn proteſtation of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, the very thing he was accuſed of before the Committee of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was moſt evidently proved againſt him, and had not the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been Prorogued, he might have met with as ſeveer a Cenſure by the Parliament, as now he is pleaſed in his Oration to wiſh and urge,—for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60490:3"/>the Diſſenters; but more of this in its due place. And that very ſame Col. <hi>S.,</hi> not many years after the war was done, when the tide was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the chief promoter in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> and other places, to procure Addreſſes to <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> and was then the moſt zealous and forwardeſt man in that Service. A mighty great ſign of his Loyalty to our preſent King, by which it ſeems his trade is Addreſſes. And the very ſame Col. <hi>S.</hi> did, as was moſt commonly reported, when he was Governour of <hi>Chepſtow</hi> Caſtle, for the King, find out a way to ſurrender or rather betray the ſame to the Parliament, without blows or force of iron or leaden bullets, <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crowns at that time being his Conqueror, the ſame Col. <hi>S.</hi> who was the Son of an Attorney, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imployed either as Agent, or Steward, to the noble Lady <hi>Cleveland</hi> or <hi>Wentworth,</hi> being called to an account for high miſdemeaners in that Truſt, and being proſecuted in the Court of <hi>Exchequer</hi> for the ſame, in the time when the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales</hi> was one of the Barrons of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> the Baron having ſeen ſo much in that Cauſe, ſo evidently proved before him of certain frauds uſed by him gave this opinion of him in open Court: <hi>That it was pitty the honour of Knight-hood ſhould ever be ſo blemiſhed as to be beſtowed on ſuch a Perſon, guilty of thoſe fowl things;</hi> which that <hi>S.</hi> who ever he was beſt knows what the good Barons reaſon was for ſuch expreſſions. And I preſume if any perſon would be further ſatisfied, whether it be the ſame Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> he may be informed from the Records there, And if it ſhould prove to be their Chairman of the Seſſions, then the world may ſee what a kind of Loyal upright perſon we have to juſtiſie and adhere unto, as the worthy order of Seſſions puts it, <hi>Fol.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Theſe things ſhould not have been touched, although a deal more is due, had it not pleaſed the Juſtice ſo much to vindicate his uprightneſs and Loyalty. By this the Reader may ſee, the old cheat whores, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes cry whore firſt, but if theſe be the men that his Majeſty muſt rely on, and which makes this buſtle and ſtir with Loyalty, in proſecuting Addreſſes and Abhorrencies, in what miſerable condition is that Prince that truſts them or their Loyalty, for can it be ſuppoſed that he that has Addreſſed to <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> one day, will not Addreſs to the King the next, if that ſide be uppermoſt, and if to the King one day, why not to his Enemies the next day, if the wind change, for what hath been, may be, if he cannot be faithful to a truſt repoſed in him, of a private Eſtate and Concernment as a Steward, certainly he is a very unſit man to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with a publick one, if theſe be the conſcientious men Sir <hi>William</hi> eſteems then <hi>Libera nos Domine.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60490:4"/>
            <p>But as to the Speech it ſelf,<note place="margin">Page 1.</note> in the firſt place his Title is tranſcendent, and far out does the common way of giving charges to Juries. For in the beginning he tells us, he hath had the Honour to Diſcourſe the Country from this Bench, ſeveral times, well what then, why muſt it be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe inſtead of a charge. I never heard of a Grand Jury that was ſworn to take notice of a Diſcourſe, but the Oath of Grand Jury men is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent all ſuch things as ſhall be given them in charge, as the Law directs. But what Sir <hi>W</hi> means by entring into a diſcourſe with them about other matters, eſpecially about how much will build a Ship, and how much his Majeſty hath laid out in the war with <hi>Argier,</hi> or to preſerve <hi>Tangier</hi> and againſt the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> as in <hi>page</hi> ſecond is a moſt ſtrange thing to be diſcourſed to a Grand Jury, unleſs he would perſwade the Grand Jury to preſent the Parliament for not making up the damage, certainly that was his intent, though he will not make the Nation ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to ſpeak it out.</p>
            <p>Well but then ſtill to the entrance into this diſcourſe, pray obſerve the method, firſt ſeek peace (good man) that is his aim, witneſs his earneſt endeavour to have Conventicles diſturbed, though his Majeſty and the Parliament thought it the beſt way to preſerve peace, was to let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for that it was never proved nor can be proved that ever ſince the Act of Uniformity, they that go to Conventicles as he calls them ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Meetings, did ever diſturb the Goverment, and if that be ſo, and that the only Church of <hi>England</hi> is that which is made by the Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, then ſure Sir <hi>W.</hi> Undermines and Acts againſt his own Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for if they were never unpaſſable, why is there all this ado to make a diſturbance, but have patience Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> by and by will tell you all.</p>
            <p>Well then in the next place he tells us page the firſt that nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures Wealth ſooner then Trade, it is well obſerved, and if the perſons that are Traders, and the greateſt Traders in the Nation, be hindred in ſerving of God according to their Conſciences, and for this ſerving of God only as they in their Conſcience believe they ought to do without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace of the Nation, muſt be torn in pieces, their Eſtates taken from them, and they put by their Trade, how ſhall the wealth of the Nation be preſerved, if he could have found out an experiment for this, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ought to have been writ in Letters of Gold, as well as repleniſh'd with Latin Sentences; well but he goes on, nor will any thing ſecure it better then Unity. If ſo, why then muſt the Neighbours of each others be forced to proſecute one another, to bing us into confuſion. Why
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60490:4"/>Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> tells you anon, and that is in plain terms, his ſenſe though not in words, the Nation can be better Governed without Unity, then with it: For the Juſtice tells you plainly that the King by his wiſdom and care hath hitherto preſerved peace without the help of Unity, for certainly (ſaith he) no Nation can be more devided then this: Well now, how will this agree together with what went before, which was that, Unity and Trade was the only way to peace, and yet now he tells us that the King hath a better way, for he can better govern without Unity, then with it, even for twenty years together. So then the conſequence is, Unity may be good, but no Unity is better, or at leaſt he thinks our King is ſo indued from above, that it is all one to Him to Govern with or without Unity, well then if it be ſo, the King hath Governed for theſe twenty years without diſturbance, though we are an United People and a divided Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as this Chairman tells us, what is the meaning then of all this buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel now about conformity in point of profit to the King, when by his own ſhewing the Government hath received no prejudice.</p>
            <p>Well but ſince Sir <hi>W.</hi> gives no better reaſon, pray let us gueſs his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for once, and thoſe may be two or three, The firſt is there wants mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to defray the publick charge, and to repay the King his own <hi>page</hi> 2. but that is but a pretence, the next reaſon the Papiſts and their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents would feign provoke the Diſſenters ſo far as to make them quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and rebel, a troubled water is the beſt for their turn, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways live by and if they could but once blow up the flame ſo high (which God forbid) then they have gained their full point which they have ſo long been aiming at both, of covering their own helliſh Plot, and the rooting out the Peſtilent Hereſy, as Sir <hi>W. S</hi>'s brother was pleaſed to term it, and could they catch the Fanaticks by this bait, not only them but the whole Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>England</hi> might be rooted up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and then the Papiſts takes the Poſſeſſion of their Lives and Eſtates all at once, which is the thing driven at, as appears by all the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and manifeſt Declarations of ſeveral of our Parliaments, they were all of that mind that the chief deſign of the Papiſts was to ſet the Proteſtants together by the ears, well fore-ſeeing that Device.</p>
            <p>And therefore both Lords and Commons ordered bills to be brought in, to Unite the Diſſenting Proteſtants all in one againſt the common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy the Papiſts, and made applications to the King, to ſtop all ſuch proſecutions as was acting againſt the Diſſenters. But a third reaſon is the vexing and perplexing the Proteſtants, may be a deſign of tiring them out, and by threats and vexatious Proſecution; to ſee if they can be forced to yield up their Reaſons, and when made poor, that they may

It cannot but be thought that this is one of the main deſignes now on foot. For a great man not long ſince openly declared that the Country was not yet fit to chooſe a Parliament they had not ſmarted enough, and ſaith he, they are for Law, but replies to himſelf with an Oath they ſhall have Law enough, that is they ſhall have the form of Law, and tricks in Law, to make a ſpecious pretence, but the deſignes is the eaſier to undoe them: and this is the Law the Juſtices intends; thoug they do not ſpeak it, which I gather from an other paſſage from the ſame Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> at another Seſſions, about nine or ten moneths ago. Councel coming to <hi>Hick's-Hall</hi> to move the Court where he ſat Chairman then, that the Commiſſion of Oyer and Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner might be read having ſomething to move, which was not proper to be moved before it was read, it being for the making of a requeſt for the Priſoners then in the Tower upon the Statute of 31 of this King. And the Chairman as well as the Juſtices being aware of it, made an excuſe to put it off till the Afternoon which was only a trick or in effect, a modeſt denial, but when that time came, and the ſame requeſt made, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excuſe was made, by the Juſtices, that though they had ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion yet they heard there was a new one Sealed, and ſo they thought it not ſafe to execute it, but that being inquired into was falſe; ſo by this trick the Commiſſion was never read, and the Law was defeated, and the Juſtices ſo to elude the Law, uſed this triek, ſo thoſe Perſons who were then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the Tower was forced to looſe the benefit of the Act that Seſſions, which was made on purpoſe, that Juſtices and Judges ſhould not dare but to deliver upon bayl, or try them as the Law directed.</p>
            <p>Well but ſaith the Juſtice and his Aſſociates that are reſolved to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to him (<hi>page</hi> 11) This is but one Inſtance, and in that the Juſtices as to the law might be miſtaken, it being a ſurprize upon them; for you hear the Juſtice himſelf in (<hi>page</hi> 2.) declares he knows not if it be againſt the Law or not, it is a ſign Juſtice is come to a fine paſs then in <hi>England,</hi> for certainly if he undertook that place of a Juſtice, he ought neither to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend he knows not the Law, nor that he was ſurprized, for at that rate the whole County may be ruined. Well but to ſhow Sir <hi>W's,</hi> Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Conſcience further, and his impartiality in a Seſſions that was held before him and the reſt of his Adherers about <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt paſt, after the Grand-Jury was ſworn, divers bills of Indictment were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60490:5"/>to the Grand-Jury for to be found againſt certain perſons of moſt wicked fame, for Subornation, Perjury, and ſuch other Villanies as ſcarce ever was heard went unpuniſhed, for they were Bills againſt a pack of Conſpirators that had a deſign to have murthered divers Noble and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons in this Kingdom by Perjury, and Witneſſes to prove thoſe Bills was produced to the Court to be ſworn in order to give their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the Grand Jury againſt thoſe Villains, but this juſt upright Sir <hi>W.</hi> and his Aſſociates ſtopped it in open Court, in the face of the Sun, and denyed the Witneſſes to be ſworn, till they had leave from the Attorney General, which certainly was the greateſt ſtab that ever was given to the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and a perfect turning and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe of Juſtice, making the Law ſubſervient, to protect the Guilty, and condemn the Innocent. This thing is of ſo high a Nature that no King in <hi>England</hi> ever did or dare attempt the ſame, or like it, publickly, what ever ſecret tricks may be underhand ſhewed, for this was not only to break the Grand Juries Oath, who are ſworn to preſent all without favour or affection. And the Juſtices Oath who are ſworn not to deny or delay Juſtice to any man, but forcing the King if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but at leaſt as much as in them lies to violate and break his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, that ſacred Tye, and the fundamental Laws of the Land. And that I may not be ſaid to ſpeak without book, I ſhall here incert a Copy of the Judges Oath and give a ſhort touch of the fundamental Laws of the Land eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom, concerning the true Execution of Juſtice, and which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are bound to obſerve by vertue of their Oath and the truſt the people repoſe in them, and this digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I hope will not be amiſs before we come further to take notice of the Speech.</p>

               <hi>For maintenance of the ſaid Articles, and Statutes, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of divers Miſchiefs and Grievances which daily happen, A Parliament ſhall be holden every year, as another time was ordained by a Statute.</hi> Now by theſe Statutes we may plainly ſee what is the Right of the Subject and the Law of the Land? Why it is frequent Parliaments to protect and preſerve the Nation, without which it is impoſſible for either the King or People to be ſafe from violence, oppreſſions, and incroachment of proud and inſolent men, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was and over will be deſigning to root up the Government, and the peoples Rights, and get them into their own Clutches, under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of their ſerving the King in his own way. And if this be ſo that both theſe laſt recited Laws be yet in force, which I am ſure neither the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60490:7"/>wiſe Juſtice or any Judg of <hi>England</hi> that is a man of Law, can ſay they are not. And ſince we have been now without a Parliament, above one whole year, ſure Sir <hi>W.</hi> in his Speech ought to have given ſome touch to the Jury, to preſent as a Grievance, and a Breach of the Law, the want of a Parliament, and it would have better befitted him to have diſcourſed about the Effluviums of the Mouth, and Haggs. And ſince we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Laws, and our Kings are ſworn to maintain them as we ſhall ſhow you anon, and that we are ſure our Kings receive the Crowns they wear from the Law of the Land. And that no King of <hi>England</hi> came into the world booted and Spurred ready prepared to ride the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to death, nor drop from Heaven in a Cloud, nor yet riſeth in a night like a Muſhroom, but that he is the Ordinance of man, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him, for their good, And that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> can deny then Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects nothing in Parliament, that is for the publick welfare as appears in the latter clauſe of the Statutes of proviſoes made in the 25 year of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 3,<note place="margin">25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 1.</note> and ſince the Juſtice is pleaſed to ſay <hi>page</hi> 1. that it is high time to ſpeak plain Engliſh, methinks he could not have ſpoken better Engliſh then this, that the want of a Parliament is the greateſt miſchief this Nation now groanes under, eſpecially if his own words are true that we are a miſerable devided people, what means can better be found out to unite and help us then the Parliament, where every mans complaint may be heard, and where the King is moſt powerful to Redreſs, which is no where ſo great as in the High Court of Parliament, but to juſtifie what I have before propounded; or rather aſſerted that Juſtice cannot be ſtopped, either by the King, his Miniſters, or his Judges on any other pretence whatever I ſhall here add to what hath been ſaid, a ſhort branch of the Statute of Proviſoes, and the Coronation Oath, which plainly ſhews that our Kings are ſo by Law and not otherwiſe of Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then any other man in ſuch Station as God calls them to, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in his ſeveral calling, may be ſaid to be by Gods permiſſion and allowance, in ſome way or other, as much as Kings in their way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which appears plainly by the Text the Juſtice hath named, to wit by me Kings Reign, but with his good leave, the Law chooſe them or elſe they come by force and are Tyrants and that will appear not only by our Records of our Engliſh Government, both in the altering and tranſlating of the Crown from one to another in all ages, by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but in holy Record too, though we are not under the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation the Jews were under, yet the Scripture tells us they chooſe and made their King, See the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Kings Cap.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 21.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60490:7"/>anoint <hi>David</hi> to be King, yet all the people met together to make <hi>David</hi> King, and to in divers other places, but I think <hi>Jure Divino</hi> is ſo far out of the caſe, that it would ſhow in the Author as much Ignorance to ſpend time to make Arguments about ſo vain and foppiſh an aſſertion as it will be if the Juſtice ſhould the next Seſſions ſpend his time in his Diſcourſe of catching of Connies in a Warren he is well acquainted with.</p>
            <p>In the Statute of Proviſoes the Parliament there aſſerts theſe words, viz. <hi>The Commons have prayed our Lord the King, that ſince the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and the Law of the ſaid Realm is ſuch that upon the miſchief and damages which happen to this Realm, he ought and is bound by his Oath, with the accord of his People in his Parliament, thereof to make Remedy and Law in removing the miſchiefs and damages which thereof en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, that it may pleaſe him thereupon to ordain remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King in the ſame Statute Anſwers the Prayer of the Commons and ſaith <hi>by his Oath he is bound to it,</hi> which Statute may be read at leaſure, to this plainly agrees the Kings Oath at his Coronation, <hi>viz. R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having given a little touch of the Old Law, and what our Rights are I ſhall now return to our Speechmaker. In page 1. he tells us we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in two Churches, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Antichurch which are the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and that of all ſorts, and to be playing with the Scriptures, he calls the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Devils, nay Legions of Devils. Why truly a man might have expected as fair quarter from a Turk or the Indians, nay from the Papiſts themſelves, for they do but account the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of all ſorts <hi>Devils,</hi> and why Sir <hi>W.</hi> ſhould ſo far oblige them who himſelf hates a <hi>Papiſt</hi> is very ſtrange. But by this the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> may ſee the Juſtices of <hi>Middleſex</hi> Chriſtianity towards them, whatever the King and Parliaments opinion of them was a little before.</p>
            <p>Well but in the next place, he tells us the reaſon why he eſteems them ſo, and that is one of them obey the King and his Laws, and the other do not, which are the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> theſe Devils and well may he term them ſo, for he tells us that they torment the Government; in the next place he tells them they diſhonour the King, and defame his Government by thoſe Pamphlets which go about the Town, in which certainly the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice read his Name, or elſe he would not have condemned a whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Men, or a Legion of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for they are many, for writing of Pamphlets, when it is not, I dare ſay, in his power to prove that any one <hi>Pamphlet</hi> he means was ever writ or publiſhed by a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Eſtabliſhed by Law: Now if the Juſtice will here undertake to condemn me without proof, and ſuch a number of Men: Why then I muſt take leave to ſay: It is ſomewhat like their late Warrants ſent out to ſummon in Conſtables to turn Informers, and when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables did not approve of that Imployment was for their Diſobedience bound to the Good behaviour, and fined Twenty pounds, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was loſt when a <hi>Certiorari</hi> came.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60490:9"/>
            <p>But yet ſome further Anſwer ought to be given as to the Diſſenters tormenting the Government; he cannot I am confident ſhew in what any of them do torment the Government, unleſs it be in not going to Church: Pray ye, Mr. <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and if it ſhall pleaſe you, how can that be ſuch a torment to the Government now, more than it hath been all other times? hath the Government any loſs in the Revenue by it, or any wounds given? Or is it the tender Conſcience of the 26 Biſhops that is ſo tormented for the ſouls of theſe poor, miſerable Diſſenters? if there be nothing elſe in the wind, no Rebellion nor Theft, nor Murder, why then where is the great torment to the Government? Do any of the Diſſenters break the Laws more than the Churchmen? Do not the Churchmen break more? If ſo many for inſtance, and if it ſhall like your Worſhip. Firſt it is true, the Diſſenters are ſtubborn Raſcals; ſome of them at leaſt, they will pray for themſelves, and in their own way, and worſhip God according to the written Word, as near as they can go, and will not come to Church. Now it is granted, in doing of this they break the Act of Uniformity; to ballance that, you Mr. <hi>Juſtice</hi> knows that many of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Loyal men, as good as ever piſſed, will be drunk ſometimes, and pretty often in a week; now ſet one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, if you pleaſe: Then the Diſſenters break another Law, they go to Meetings, contrary to another Act; well, but you know, Sir, ſometimes they pay dear for it, as people ſay at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> &amp;c. But if that do not ſerve turn, there are many of the Church of <hi>England</hi> good Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al men, will ſwear and damn moſt confoundedly ſometimes, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed againſt the Act, and the Law of Chriſtianity too: now Sir here is a <hi>Rowland</hi> for your <hi>Oliver:</hi> and methinks the Juſtices of <hi>Middleſex</hi> might have been ſo conſciencious, as to have diſcourſed ſomething of the breach of theſe Laws, as well as altogether upon the poor Diſſenters. There is another Law the Diſſenting Miniſters break, which is the Act for living within five miles of a Corporation; to anſwer that, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, notwithſtanding the Act of Non-reſidence at their Pariſh Church, yet many of them Loyal Churchmen ſcarce ever come at it, except for their Tythes. Now Sir, I would have you give me leave to tell you one plain and homely ſtory, and ſo end the firſt Page. There was a Wench in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had been with a Prieſt at Confeſſion, and being there, freely uncaſed her ſelf of all her ſins to the Prieſt, which proved very great ſins, and ſomething aſtoniſhing to the good man, the firſt was; ſhe confeſſed ſhe had been a great Thief, the Prieſt replyed that was very bad and a great ſin, but ſaith ſhe, I gave ſo much money to the poor after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; well quoth the Prieſt put that to that, the next was, ſhe had been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60490:10"/>a great Whore, whereat the Prieſt ſtarted being amazed thereat: but ſaid ſhe, oh Sir, but I did ſuch a Pennance ſuch a time, and faſted ſo long; well then ſaid the Prieſt put that to that: another ſin whereof ſhe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelf guilty, was the wronging of her Parents, which was a bad ſin too; but ſaid ſhe, my Father and Mother were Hereticks: well then ſaid the Prieſt put that to that. The next day the Prieſt coming again to ſee his child, and asking her how ſhe did, ſhe replyed ſmilingly, well I thank you Father, ſhe ſtill ſmiling at him occaſioned by a wart the Prieſt had upon his Noſe, and he being urgent to know the cauſe of her ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhe at laſt, after craving his pardon, with a promiſe not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with her, told him, Sir you have a wart upon your Noſe, I ſaith he, ſo I have, and I have another upon my Ar—, put that to that, Sir, as you did yeſterday. But now I the hope Courteous Reader will pardon this ſlip, though I leave Sir <hi>W.</hi> at his pleaſure. In <hi>page 2d.</hi> Sir <hi>W.</hi> tells the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Conventiclers had abuſed and reviled thoſe officers and others who in obedience to their Commands have endeavoured to put the Laws in Execution: if the Diſſenters have done ſo, they are highly to blame; but if neither himſelf nor all his fellow Juſtices can ſhew wherein they have ſo abuſed or reviled them for doing their duty, ſure then the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters have great cauſe to ſay Sir <hi>W.</hi> is not ſure any of them hath ſo done, becauſe he neither names the perſon that did the fact, nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the abuſe was done; ſome of the Standers by I am told was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir <hi>W's</hi> meaning was the Conſtables, and the Pamphlets called Order of Seſſions was, what he meant, or the Anſwer to them: now if his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would be pleaſed but to explain himſelf, both as to the perſons and things he ſpeaks of, he would highly add to his former merits; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are like to be in the dark ſtill, notwithſtanding his ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallency.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>William</hi> goes on <hi>page</hi> 2. the queſtion he askes is, he would know of any ſober thinking man, which of the two parties his prudence would invite him too, whether thoſe under his Majeſties, and the Laws Protection, or to that party which leads through Briars and Thornes, which I ſuppoſe he meanes to be the Diſſenters, if ſo, then I muſt tell him that the Laws do equally Protect both the one and the other, and for him to ſtart ſuch a queſtion under his favour, is no leſs then to tell the world that his Majeſty will protect one and not the other, and ſince Sir <hi>W.</hi> is reſolved to pun upon the honeſt plain Country Jury-men that hath not been uſed to be ſo accoſted by ſuch Rhetorick heretofore, it may not be amiſs to ſift this part of the Speech a little further: In this page, he tells the Country men of ſlippery places where they ſhall never be able
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60490:10"/>to ſtand their groud; but what ground he means, is kept ſecret, and therefore we can't gueſs at the meaning, which is ſuppos'd to be this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Grand-Jury men, and all that hear me this day, I tell you I am a thinking man, I think of the times paſt when I was a Col. and how I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved my ſelf in <hi>Richard's</hi> time paſt, when I Addreſſed to him, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming then with the Tide, I was ſafe, I ſcorned that pittiful thing called concience, I alwayes trod upon ſure ground, and in froſty, hard weather tho' the wind blew never ſo hard, yet I always ſheltered my ſelf under ſome penthouſe, though it was but a thatched Cottage; I would never deny my ſelf in any thing, but whatever <hi>Richard,</hi> who then Reigned <hi>de facto,</hi> though not <hi>de jure,</hi> did, yet I was the ſame to him as I pretend now to the King; and I ſtood by that means faſt, and by that meanes I ſtand faſt now, and ſo may you grand Jury-men, if you will but think on me, you never need fear treading upon Knives or Razors; for what ever Card turns up Trump; I have a Knave at all times ready, both in heart and hand: And therefore you thinking Grand Jury men, remember me, and be ſure to take care of ſelf preſervation, and be obedient to me, and preſent theſe unthinking people that do not know their own ſafety: But to proceed in this, <hi>Page. 2d.</hi> here is ſo much of excellent Variety, and depth of Wiſdom, that is ſeems wonderful, eſpecially if we conſider the State matters here in this page ſet forth, and that is, he not only tells us of the expence of money his Majeſty hath been at, as was before hinted, and the benefit like to accrew to Trade by the peace with <hi>Algier,</hi> and the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade; but he ſeems to underſtand the whole ſeries of all the State affairs of the King, as a great and learned <hi>Privy Councellor;</hi> For he tells you that ſome had the impudence to report that <hi>Tangier</hi> was or would be ſold to the <hi>French</hi> King; how was it poſſible the Juſtice ſhould know that, except he were of the Cabinet Councel at home, or the <hi>French</hi> Kings Councel abroad? For he doth not ſay he heard it was reported to be ſold, or would be ſold, but that ſome had the impudence to ſay ſo, and this muſt be certainly to himſelf it was ſpoken, or elſe he deviſed it, for he cannot produce his Author: but that which may cauſe a further belief of his being a Courtier, and in the moſt deepeſt State of affairs, is his telling us in the ſame page, the very exact quantity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the thirty Capital Ships will coſt more then the <hi>Parliament</hi> did give, which is thus; the King was forced to advance 100000 of his own money; now it is a very great wonder that this Juſtice in ſuch a capacity not being a Ship-wright, ſhould exactly know theſe things, if he be not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Privy Councel,</hi> or one of the Treaſury: and that which makes it a wonder how he comes to know the exact charge is, that yet all the thirty
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60490:11"/>Capital Ships are not built, and ſome of them not ſo much as begun to this day. But I ſuppoſe Sir <hi>W.</hi> did not ſpeak from a Command he had, but to ſhew his zeal to raiſe the 100000 l. that would be wanting when the Ships were done, or rather that he might have one fling at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for being ſo abſurd as not to compute their Matters right, nor give money enough; for Sir <hi>W.</hi> always hath a good wiſh, or a good wrod, for the Parliament <hi>ſince he was ſummon'd before the Committee.</hi> Well, but now in the third page he tells us the whole Charge the King haht diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed, is about 800000 l. which ought to be paid him by the people for whom it was disburſted; and that the Eſtabliſh'd Revenue will not ballance the neceſſary Charges of the Government; and where ſhall the accidental charge be born? I am confident the King never bid him put ſuch a queſtion to the Grand-Jury, for this reaſon, becauſe he well knows, they nor their whole ſingle County cannot do it if it were lawful for Loans, or Ship-money, or Privy-Seals to go about the Country again, as was done by the wicked enemies of the King and Kingdom heretofore, to keep off Parliaments, that they that had acted Roguery and Villany in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in the late King's Time, might not be called to account, which in all probability is the deſign of this Juſtice if he dare ſpeak out; and that he can mean no leſs ſeems moſt plain, for what ſhould he elſe tell the Grand-Jury of ſuch things as theſe which they have no conuſance of in the leaſt: and for the Juſtices ſaying he hath heard in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that the Revenue will not defray the charges of the Government, it is moſt like he hath. For the Reader may pleaſe to remember, that Sir <hi>W.</hi> was one of that long Pentionary-Parliament which was always free of giving, what ſome of them was hired to give, as appears by the Votes of another Houſe. And may it not well be conjectured now from his experience he pretends in the Revenue of the Crown, as he ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to us, that either he is, or would be Lord Treaſurer, or at leaſt one of the Commons very ſhortly by this Speech, Howſoever, ſure, he cannot miſs of ſome great place of Truſt in the State, becauſe he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is pleaſed in this third page to tell us not only that the Subjects ought to pay it with Intereſt and with thanks, but they had done it before now, if the Diſſenters and Differences that are among us had not prevented it; and wiſe men lay it upon the Conventicles being ſuffered, thus he hath hit the point certainly, and now we come to know what is the reaſon all of a ſuddain the Conventiclers and Diſſenters are diſturbed, which we never knew before, and that is, the King hath disburſed a great deal of money, and the Diſſenters will neither pay it themſelves for the benefit they enjoy of the Conventicles, nor will let others pay it. If this be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60490:11"/>ſo, then 'tis no wonder at this eager proſecution, and this inciting Speech to ſtir up the Jurors; but how comes it to paſs it was not found out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Conventicles hinder'd the King of his money disburſed? Is it not known both to thinking and unthinking people, that when the greateſt Gifts and Sums of Money that ever was given the King that now is, there was as many Diſſenters and Conventicles as now, and that at all times they inſtead of hindering fo a good a Work ever paid their ſhares very chearfully, witneſs the great Tax 2500000 l. at once, and 1200000 l. at another time in the Penſionary Parliament, and other Sums ſince. And for the venom and infection of the Conventicle Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as he is pleaſed to call them, it cannot be proved that they have ever preached or taught Sedition, either in thoſe Times, or now; much leſs to come within the compaſs of the Act the Juſtice ſeems to hint at, and the Act of the 17th of this King if there be any ſuch, was as much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated then as ever it hath been ſince; and it doth not appear, nor can by any art uhe Juſtice can uſe, that ever the Diſſenters or Conventiclers did either preach or pray againſt Gifts and Grants of money to ſupply the King's Affairs, eſpecially when the good of the Nation required it. And without doubt thoſe Diſſenters and Conventiclers are, and ever were as ready with their Purſes to ſerve the King and Country as any of the Abhorrers ever were, or ever will be, notwithſtanding their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick expreſſions. But yet to bring in Popery, or ſupport Popiſh Deſigns, the Diſſenters will not whatever the Abhorrers may yield to. It is true, in ſome of the <hi>Gazers</hi> great promiſes and aſſurances, have been lately made, to ſtand by the King with their Lives and Fortunes, and their Purſes to be ever at the Kings Command: And not onely ſo, but have by their Abhorrences declared their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to chooſe ſuch Members for the next Parliament as his Majeſty ſhall approve of. Now if theſe ſtubborn Fanaticks would have been ſo mannerly as to have done that too; then it is more than probable that all this proſecution againſt the Diſſenters in the Juſtices opinion might ceaſe too. And it cannot be any wonder that the Abhorrers ſhould promiſe to aſſiſt his Majeſty with their Purſes; for they have nothing to aſſiſt the him with, but what comes from the King either in Places or Gifts. Well, but after all tho'; ſometimes the Juſtice if for the Diviſions to be made up, that the King may be repaid with Intereſt, and therefore ſaith, it is high time to do it; yet that muſt not be done by giving any grains of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to the Diſſenters ſide at all, or to bear with this weakneſs in things indifferent, or to make any ſtep of compaſſion towards them in leaving off one ſmall Ceremony or ſin out of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to win them,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60490:12"/>no not for the whole World, and all the Diſſenters ſouls to boot, but the unity the Juſtice would ſeem to aim at is, that whatever the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>England</hi> ſay the Diſſenters muſt do, that muſt be done, or elſe ſtop their mouths; the Diſſenters infectious Breath will undo us all; and and give us the Plague, beſides want of money; therefore Inſtead of any condiſcention to them, ſtop their mouths with the Act of the 17th of this King, leaſt they grow too formidable. Here is the Union the Juſtice but now talked of in his third page; O rare charitable Juſtice and good natur'd man!</p>
            <p>Well, but what if Sir <hi>W.</hi> ſhould be out in his Polliticks; that the way to Union, is to force it by devouring the Diſſenters by penal Laws; now I am apt to think he is out, if he will but give himſelf leave to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himſelf a little as to Hiſtory, both ſacred and prophane; and let him but ſhow in any one place that ever the force of the Civil Magiſtrate, or by any one force of Arms in the whole world in matters of Religion, it ever prevailed, or effected ſuch an end as Sir <hi>W.</hi> would make the world believe he aims at; the Scripture tells us, have a care leſt you be found fighting againſt God; and adviſes to let the Secrets as they were called by the Jews and the Phariſees in the Apoſtles Time alone; for ſaid a wiſe man among them then to the Councel, have a care what you do, if this be of God it will ſtand, if not it will ſoon come to nought: All that ye do againſt them will come to nought if they be of God; for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is neither to be played withall nor affrighted from; and it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrives beſt when the Enemies of it do moſt induſtriouſly oppoſe it. God's Juſtice hath a longer reach Mr. <hi>Juſtice,</hi> than the fingers of the King, or the Temporal Law, more than you are aware of; therefore it may be that all your malice can amount to, will be ſo far from rooting up the Diſſenters, and ſtopping the mouths of their Teachers that it may rather increaſe than decreaſe; and it may be as far out of your power to hinder it, as it was once out of your power to keep <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> in the Chair after you had taken ſo much pains in addreſſing him: And for your fear of the Diſſenters being formidable to the Government, as you ſay in this page, if they be ſo formidable in their help to ſupport the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with their Perſons, and Purſes as heretofore they have been in Reſtoring His preſent Majeſty, then ſure there will be no great terrour upon the Government from them, be they never ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And for what you are pleaſed to ſay they are a Herd of Swine, that when one being chaſed all the reſt go and condole, pray where is the evil of that, if it were ſo? but I have been otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that they are not ſo kind and natural one to the other,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60490:12"/>However ſince you have ſo compared them to ſwine, and ſince it is their nature, as you ſay, to condole one with another, when they are all chaſed, I wiſh that part of your Speech were true, that theſe Diſſenters will make your words good, and ſtand by one another in Righteous and good things, to oppoſe the wicked malice of their enemies, who daily watch, not only for their goods and eſtate, but for their blood too, could they have but an opportunity once put into their hands; which as is ſaid, you, and the reſt, Sir <hi>W.</hi> of your fellow Juſtices, were indeavouring after, when a Petition was by you preferred, that the Sheriffs of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi> might not be choſe by the City; could you Sir <hi>W.</hi> and the reſt of your crew, but have got that either by hook or by crook, you would no doubt have ſtopped all their mouths, having before ſettled your Evidence ready for the purpoſe. But Sir <hi>W.</hi> do but have patience and keep the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> cattle together a little longer, and you do not know how fortunate you may be after Midſummer day next; and then have at the Beaſts at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> theſe unreaſonable Diſſenters that will not believe their Mother the Church, nor pin their faith upon the Crape-Gonorum: Thus our Barronet lays about him in this Page againſt theſe hoggs, beaſts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable men, now is it not a pitty this Gentleman had not acted in Doctor <hi>Sprat's</hi> place the other day, and <hi>Sprat</hi> in his; if it had been ſo, I am confident the Knight would have done more in the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion by his Speech to the Artillery men, than the Doctor did for the word of the Apoſtle, and the very names of unreaſonable men and wild Beaſts would certainly have ſounded very ſweet to that Auditory, for the Doctor took all to be unreaſonable men that refuſed to dine with them that day, and yet dared to eat their dinner together the next day in another place than where the D. was. And if the Doctor had but ſpoke half ſo much as a Divine to the Grand-Jury about Hoggs and Religion, the Jury could not for ſhame but have believed him, becauſe he hath authority to ſpeak Scripture: But what authority the Juſtice had to ſpeak ſo to the Grand-Jury, when he was not in Orders, is not yet known; and it is well if the Church do not take him to task, for medling with that which did not concern him, and which indeed is another man's trade, and it was the Juſtice-trade, to have preached the neceſſity of buying ſwords to ſuppreſs the Diſſenters, and keep their mouths ſtopped: well but before we leave this Page, we ſhall find out Sir <hi>W's</hi> Religion, I dare lay a groat on't; for he tells us in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> now, what I did but ſuppoſe before, that he was once on the other ſide; for, ſaith he, there are not more unreaſonable men, than ſome we have in <hi>England.</hi> I have heretofore had an indifferent good opinion of the Diſſenters, I thought they had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60490:13"/>been as they pretended, a peaceable ſober ſort of People, and that they had deſired nothing but liberty of Conſcience, and Indulgence. So then once by his own ſhewing, he was of another mind then now he is? Well, what changed him in his diſcourſe in this place. it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the unreaſonable men that are in <hi>England;</hi> but he forgets to tell us who they are, and wherein it appears ſo; but if you believe himſelf, the unreaſonableneſs of ſome men, is the main reaſon that makes him now, not of the opinion he was before, and that ſerves him well enough for an excuſe. But how was he miſtaken about their being a ſober, quiet ſort of People? what hath altered his mind? have they been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly or unquiet, more then himſelf, have they done any evil to the Publick now, more then they did before, when he had his good opinion of them? nothing of that can appear. But to be plain, in the <hi>4th. Page</hi> he tells you what hath altered him; why it is his tenaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the Diſſenters aim at Dominion, and therefore he cannot have any longer a good Opinion of them, but ſtill this is but to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by loading of others with ſuch untruths, as there is nothing the leaſt colour for it, nor was ever proved againſt them, unleſs he means by Dominion, that the Diſſenters will have the Dominion over their own Eſtates, and Families, and not ſuffer others to have it from them, without better Warrant from the Law then any this <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Juſtice can ſhew to the contrary; for the Diſſenters do think they may with as much Law and Juſtice defend their Liberties and Properties, as the Juſtice may find Law to compel them to conformity in point of Church Diſcipline. But now the Juſtice muſt have one flout or fling at tender conſciences in this <hi>Page,</hi> or elſe the fat will be in the fire, and no wonder at all, why he cannot let that alone, the reaſon may be becauſe he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt his, if ever he had one, is ſomething like the Devil, that hates man, becauſe he is in a better State then himſelf; otherwiſe ſure he would not mock and jeer at tender conſcienes and liberty of conſcience, as if their were no ſuch thing left, but all was a piece of Pagentry like my Lord Mayor's ſhow, as he ſaith, to draw the Eyes of Spectators up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The Juſtice may know it is dangerous to meddle with Edge tools.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60490:13"/>
            <p>But to proceed, the Knight tells us, <hi>He met with a Pamphlet the other day, wherein he read a Ticket to a Feaſt at the two Halls.</hi> The Pamphlet he means, I ſuppoſe, may be the <hi>Gazette,</hi> which forbids, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Authority, the ſeditious Deſign of dining together at <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Hall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in regard his R. H. was not to be there, or becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be merry without a Licence from the Court. Truly it was a horrible Deſign of thoſe Whigs, to offer to eat together, and give God thanks for Mercies, and not firſt conſult the Stars, or the Court at <hi>Milky-Hall.</hi> And that which more affrighted the Loyal Party was, there were no leſs than thirty odd <hi>Affidavits</hi> produced, or intended in due time; which made it appear, that all the Pye-cruſt was Walls, Batteries, and ſtrong Fortreſſes, within which were hid all ſorts of Warlike Proviſion, Blunderbuſſes only excepted. And moſt certain it is, this was the moſt deſperate Aſſociation that has been theſe many Years, fit to be abhorr'd in the next Return, when thoſe now upon the Wheel ſhall be ſpun out; for as the Juſtice tells us, <hi>It is like the old Way of Aſſociating, or blowing a Trumpet before a War.</hi> But the Ticket-Feaſt at <hi>Merchant-Taylors Hall,</hi> was not half ſo dangerous, tho the Text was, <hi>Sell your Garments, and buy a Sword.</hi> Nor had the Apprentices Feaſt, with the four Bucks, and the Tun of Wine, the laſt Summer in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> any evil Intent at all, only a good Example for their Maſters, to huzza, drink the Pope's Health, and bid defiance to their Maſters, ſo long as they were ſet on work by ſome of their Maſters Maſters, not to be named. Well, for the preſent be it ſo, till it can be better; however, ſober, thinking Men may remember theſe Things without offence, I hope, as well as the Juſtice the two Hall-Feaſts by Tickets.</p>
            <p>Now in the fourth Page, he further tells us, <hi>That this Aſſociating by Tickets is an old Way; it looks like blowing the Trumpet, and making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation (Who is on my ſide? who?)</hi> And by the Words which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Sentence, he makes it to be a <hi>Corah</hi>'s Rebellion, which was, Murmuring againſt God. Therefore it ought to be conſidered, what ground there is for this ſevere Charge, as to its being an old way to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate by Tickets. Now it is true, every Year, not only the Loyal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery-Company do feaſt, and aſſociate by Tickets; but divers Citizens, who were born in ſuch and ſuch Counties, do alſo every Year by Tickets aſſociate together to feaſt, in remembrance of their County: And no notice was ever taken of it before, that ſuch a thing was Rebellion, or a Murmuring againſt God or the Government. But the Juſtice (I preſume) takes it, they may feaſt any where but in thoſe infectious Halls, or elſe he would not have condemned in one, what is often allowed to others.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60490:14"/>Well, but there is ſomething more in it yet, and that is, The Ticket ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, to thank God for delivering the King and Kingdom from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; and this was that which ſpoil'd the Feaſt. Beſides, theſe Men that were to be at it, had forgotten to invite the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> and were not for abhorring a Thing of Rags, or a <hi>Chymaera</hi> in the Air, of their own ſetting up. And for theſe Men to meet, was not to be born withal. But how it looks Rebellion, is yet uncertain; therefore the Reader muſt ſee for himſelf, for at preſent we are in the dark. But the Juſtice, in this Page too, tells us, <hi>It was a making of Parties.</hi> He ought to have conſidered it well, before he had ſpoke ſuch unadviſed Words; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, would he, and the reſt of his Aſſociates, but conſider how induſtriouſly they have laboured to make Parties, by getting Addreſſes and Abborren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies throughout <hi>England,</hi> not only againſt a Fiction of their own Brain, but againſt Parliaments themſelves, as moſt manifeſtly appears by the wording of their Abhorrencies: For tho they are ſo modeſt, as not to expreſs their abhorring Parliaments in Words at length; yet they have abhorred the Votes, Reſolutions, and Actions of the beſt, wiſeſt, and richeſt Parliament, that ever <hi>England</hi> had: And ſome of them not only grin at them privately, but have traduced them, as if the very Houſe of Commons were all Rebels themſelves againſt his Royal Highneſs. And tho thoſe Abhorrers, the moſt of them, have not dared to give the Houſe of Commons the Lie; yet ſome of them have told us plainly, that they will never chuſe ſuch again, as ſhall act contrary to the Intereſt of his Royal Highneſs. But that which ſhews theſe Fellows to be Knaves as well as Fools, is, They always bark and ſpit their Venom behind the Parliament's Back, which is a good ſure way; but never dare ſay any thing when they are ſitting, but, <hi>Roger</hi> like, run away. Yet let them have a care, there will come another Parliament, whatever theſe Fools are made to believe; tho it is not doubted, but thoſe that ſet them on work dare aſſure thoſe abhorring Raſcals, there never ſhall be any more Parliaments to call them to account, and that all is their own. But let ſuch know, it is this Nation's Right to have Parliaments, and a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt come within three Years, by a Law made in this Kings Time, and they muſt fit too, if theſe Abhorrers do not get Popery eſtabliſhed before that time, which tho they labour hard for, yet they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But if a Parliament ſhould come, as certainly it will, then they that drew and contrived theſe Abhorrencies in Papers for them, will run away, and leave the Subſcribers in the Lurch, as <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> uſed to do: And then 'tis ten to one, but <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod, the Juſtice tells us of in this Page, will ſwallow up the <hi>Egyptian Magicians Rods,</hi> which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60490:14"/>have devoured and abhorred parliaments, and their Proceedings; and the King's Rod, that the wiſe Juſtice would lay upon the Diſſenters Backs, may chance to light upon his own, and his Aſſociates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if the King and the Law,</hi> the Juſtice tells us, <hi>cannot reach thoſe ſubtil Men, Divine Juſtice may.</hi> In Anſwer to that, I ſhall only ſay this by way of Retort, That if we ſhould be ſo miſerable, as not to have our juſt Rights by Parliaments, the Divine Vengeance (I doubt not) will reach thoſe Villains, that have ſo eagerly laboured, Night and Day, to unhinge the Government. For he that is againſt the Parliament, is not only againſt his own Right and Privilege, but againſt the Foundation of our Government; and he that knows not that, I will adventure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him much more an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> than the Juſtice himſelf. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Juſtice in this Page threatens the Diſſenters with the Scepter, he may know, that all Scepters are, or ought to be Scepters of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and to preſerve, not to deſtroy, the Innocent. And thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, whatever Opinion the Juſtice may have, think themſelves as little concerned in that, as the Juſtice himſelf, they having as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on their ſide to be ſhelter'd under that righteous Scepter, as his Worſhip.</p>
            <p>In the next place, it cannot be well paſs'd over, the Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this fourth Page the Juſtice quotes, that is, <hi>The Children of this World are wiſer in their Generation than the Children of Light:</hi> Which the Juſtice alludes to the Phanaticks taking one anothers Parts, nad not buying and ſelling, or trading with any but their own Party: <hi>Nay, they will,</hi> ſaith the Juſtice, <hi>have no manner of Commerce with the Church-Party; and that is to ſet up a Common-wealth in a Kingdom, a moſt dangerous thing!</hi> This is indeed a home Charge, and as much Falſhood and Malice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in it, as ever was. But we know whom the Juſtice had this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from, no other than thoſe Inſtruments the Jeſuits, whoſe Motto is, <hi>Divide &amp; impera.</hi> And here the Juſtice hath moſt exactly followed their Counſel: For in what Terms could he have more fully ſhown his Intentions of dividing, than in aſſerting, That the Diſſenters will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with no Body but themſelves, and are ſetting up a Common-wealth in a Kingdom, without giving one Example, or Colour to prove ſuch a Deſign in them? And it may be asked the Juſtice, who it is can do more at one time to divide us, than ſuch a Speech? But why muſt the Diſſenters Trading together, and taking one anothers Parts, be a Deſign againſt the Government, more than of thoſe that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Church-Party? Is it not as lawful for one as well as the other Sort, to trade with whom they will, and to eat and drink with whom
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60490:15"/>they pleaſe? If ſo, then it is moſt plain, the boaſting Church-Men do feaſt together often, and aſſociate themſelves in Clubs, Cabals, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and Coffee-Houſes, and divers other Places, both Sundays and Working-Days, to manage the Cauſe which the Juſtice aims at; and the Church-men in reality, as they would be accounted, (ſuch as they are) have in reality ſtuck by their Champion <hi>Cradock</hi> ſo far, that no leſs than two Knights, and four or five Eſquires and Gentlemen, to ſave their Brother <hi>Cradock,</hi> have joined together in a ſolemn Oath before the Judg, that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> doth live in <hi>Thanet-Houſe,</hi> and is a great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the City. I am confident, the Juſtice cannot ſhew us any ſuch voluntary Oath of Men of their Quality, that ever did ſo far take one anothers Parts among the Diſſenters, as to ſwear in Clubs.</p>
            <p>So after the Juſtice had ſhewed the Diſſenters Dealings, of laying their Heads together in diſturbing the Peace, in the next place, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. he tells us in praiſe of the Church Pary, and in oppoſition to the Diſſenters, that they (the Chuch Party) are good honeſt Men in theſe Words, <hi>viz. The Church Party, the Children of Light, they truſt in a good Cauſe, put out their own Eyes, and will neither ſee their Danger or Intereſt, moſt of them endeavour to build upon their own Ground, and raiſe to themſelves Pyramids of Honour and Riches, and have not minded them of the ſame Party, who are forced to ſhift for themſelves as well as they can.</hi> Now I would have the ingenuous Church-Men conſider, what a great deal of Honour this Gentleman hath done them, he has, to vindicate them, called them blind Fools, nay, ſuch Fools, that no brute Beaſts can be worſe; what is it I pray you to them, to put out their own Eyes, and not ſee for themſelves, and when that is done, he tells us, it is the only way to get Riches. If this be the way of the Children of Light to put out their own Eyes, and truſt to others, I pray God, with all my Heart, that I may be in Darkneſs ſtill, and that this Child of Light, tho a Church-Man, may get Honour, and in his own way, for my part I will neither envy his, nor his Church-Men's Happineſs as to their Wiſdom, nor as to their Honour and Riches; but this I may ſay, that had the Church of <hi>England-men</hi> received ſuch a Vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, from a Diſſenter, as this, certainly they would have called loudly for Satisfaction, either from the Court Chriſtian, or our Temporal Courts; What, call them ſuch Fools! and treat them as ſuch as will pull out their own Eyes and not ſee, can the Church-Men forgive this? I dare not ſay they cannot, becauſe ſome of them are Men of great Charity, but were it not for that, doubtleſs ſuch an Affront as this, would be enough to raiſe the whole <hi>poſſe</hi> Clergy about the Knights Eyes; for in effect he calls them blind Papiſts, for none but thoſe poor deluded Souls,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60490:15"/>that ever live in the Light of the Sun, would rather truſt other Folks Eyes than their own.</p>
            <p>Well, but what muſt not a Juſtice make a ſlip, but there muſt be all this notice taken! yes ſure, he may be allowed many when he means well: for in this whole Speech, if you obſerve it, and if you believe himſelf, <hi>He doth ſay, and do, all for the Eſtabliſhed Church, and the Publick Good</hi> Now then, if ſo, he ought to have Mercy ſhewn him. In the next place, you will find he deſerves it too, becauſe the Diſſenters in this <hi>page,</hi> are made by the ſame Man, <hi>Coblers, and nothing but their laſt is their Coat,</hi> and ſo fearful is he of them, <hi>If,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>the Cards ſhould be ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led again, that theſe Coblers will have all the Shoes, and himſelf go Bare-foot;</hi> that he adviſes here in this Page, <hi>That it is not prudent to truſt them, tho they are contented with their own Vertue;</hi> a moſt ſtrange Paradox! what if they will be contented with their own Vertue, ſhan't they be let alone? it is mighty hard, eſpecially, when, in the next place, he himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Vertue as a choice Plant, or Tree that bears excellent Fruit; and ſaith he, <hi>The Gardiners muſt nouriſh and cheriſh this Plant and Tree, or elſe in time this Tree will bear ſower Fruit;</hi> that is, I ſuppoſe, he means the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and you Grand Inqueſt-men, you muſt Preſent theſe Diſſenters that we may get ſome of their Money, lop off their looſe Twigs, and Wild-Sprigs, that makes them too rich and too proud, and then thier Fruit will be Savoury, ſuch as I like; for tho I like not the Men, yet their Money I like, and ſo do all their Enemies; but to quiet the Church, whom before he abuſed, he now makes them full amends again, for ſaith he in this <hi>Page,</hi> viz. <hi>I hope for the Honour of the King, and Safety of the Government, no Man for the future ſhall be employed, until he be firſt ſifted and winnowed, and if any Grain of Faction be found in him, he ſhall be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide:</hi> But then Sir <hi>W.</hi> What will you do, and your Addreſſers? Do you not remember, Sir <hi>W.</hi> the very day you made this learned Speech? when you and the reſt of the Tribe were withdrawn out of the Court, you propounded, or at leaſt abetted, one of the greateſt pieces of Faction that ever was done in <hi>England</hi> this 20 Years, except <hi>F. H.</hi> which was, it was urged among you Juſtices, to Addreſs His Majeſty, that he would be pleaſed to keep the Duke by him at home to join with him in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at leaſt to aſſiſt him therein? Pray Sir <hi>W.</hi> had you gone on in this Addreſs, had it not been the heighth of Faction and Sedition, if not High-Treaſon, in deſigning to alter the Government? What, are you in ſuch haſte, that you cannot ſtay the time, muſt Popery and Proteſtantiſm be joined together in our days? Pray Sir, will you, before your next Speech, conſider it well: and tho you abhor the Parliaments, becauſe they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60490:16"/>would have no Popiſh Succeſſor, yet methinks you ſhould not dig a Grave for our King and Government, while he is alive: and what other conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſober thinking Men, as you call them, can make of ſuch Deſigns, time may ſhew; but for your placing ſo much upon that Text, <hi>By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Juſtice;</hi> I know not what you mean, unleſs you would by that Scripture inſinuate, that becauſe there is ſuch a place of Scripture, therefore the People ſhould have no Law of the Land to be their Standard, but the Will of the Prince to be abſolute, Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, above all Laws, and no Bounds to be ſet by the Law of the Land: if ſo, our Anceſtors were Fools to make the Coronation Oath, and the good Statutes, with divers others before recited. But Sir <hi>W.</hi> all this you do to be Great, and by this it may be you may be ſo fond, as to believe you make the King great too, tho it be the quite contrary way; nay, ſuch Men as you that take away all Law, do totally leſſen both the Prince, the Nation, and the Government; for if the King have no better Title than his Sword, or the <hi>Jure Divino</hi>-ſhip you ſpeak off, then <hi>Lord have Mercy on him.</hi> For you Sir <hi>W.</hi> by the ſame Rule, tho but an Attorneys Son, if you can but make your ſelf popular enough, and get a long Sword, caſed with a Pretence of a Divine Right, you may be King as well as any, only, I think, if you ſhould do ſo, and not make your Sword long enough, you may chance to find, that the <hi>Jure Regnum,</hi> would ſpoil your <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to pleaſe you in ſomething, and not to thwart all your dark Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo hard to be underſtood; we will for once, as you inſinuate, allow that Government is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and the Ordinance of God, but the Modes and Forms were ever yet left to Man, which in all Countries whatſoever, have been chalked out by the People themſelves, for their Weal and Government. And if our ancient Records may be credited, no Nation under Heaven ever eſtabliſhed better Rules for Government, than this Kingdom hath done; for here, neither the Prince can by Law hurt the People, nor the People the Prince, and the Law is the Standard between them and the Protector of both: which, ſure Sir <hi>W.</hi> you ought to have known, or at leaſt to have ſhown us, what Text of Scripture it is that eſtabliſheth our Kings in <hi>England,</hi> and gives them Authority above the Law; but when you have ſaid all, the Kingſhip of <hi>England</hi> is but an Office, and a Truſt repoſed in them by the Law of the Land, under your good Favour: And they are made Kings by Humane Laws, but to whom the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are accountable, I am not to queſtion, nor do I think it fit for you. And for your ſaying the King, ought not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by the People, to do any thing which he knows is contrary to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60490:16"/>his Duty and Truſt; I ſay ſo too: but how this will amend the Matter, or plead for your deſigning to join ſome Perſon with him, as was told you before, I know not, but by the Rule of Contrary, if the People ought not to importune the King, nor he to grant what is not juſt, as is clear they ought not; then ſure, both the People ought to importune the King, and he to grant them all that is Juſt and Right, and what by the Law, and his Sacred Oath he is bound to do. And then Sir <hi>W.</hi> I will take leave to tell you, and make your beſt on 't, that the People ought in this imminent time of danger, both from your Friends the Papiſts at home, and the dangers from abroad, to importune the King for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as their Right by Law, according to the Statutes of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> And if you are ſo conſcientious a Man, and mean for the Law and right Government of <hi>England,</hi> as you pretend, I do not doubt in the leaſt, but you will help forward ſuch a Petition; and ſince the Juſtice tells us, that a Prince muſt be juſt againſt the importuning of his Subjects; I hope Sir <hi>W.</hi> you that ſay ſo, will not be ſo unjuſt as not to begin ſo good a work, ſince you have ever had the knack of Addreſſing.</p>
            <p>And now we are in the ſixth Page come to Sir <hi>W</hi>'s Hear-ſay, that is, <hi>The King, I have heard, was preſſed to exclude the D. of Y. Pray,</hi> ſaith the Juſtice, <hi>examine the Juſtice of that? can it be juſt, ſaith he, to puniſh</hi> in preſonti <hi>for a Fault to be committed</hi> in futuro? Divine Sir <hi>William!</hi> he muſt ſtill have a fling at the Parliament, it is as good Leachery to him to ſcratch there, as to be a ſtanding Stallion in another place; well, but this is a grand Fault of the Parliament no doubt: What, puniſh a Man before he had committed any Fault, as he tells the Grand Jury! ſurely they would not find a Bill againſt any Man for a Fault that might be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted! Now obſerve the cunning of this Abuſe that he would ſham upon the unthinking People, of a Wrong the Parliament was about; pray who was, or who would have been wronged if ſuch a Bill had paſſed? altho for my own part, I ever thought there were other Bills more needful. Is it not ſtrange the whole Nation in a Body in three ſeveral Parliaments, could be ſo fooliſh and wicked, as not to ſee the Sin and Evil of this thing, as well as the Juſtice? and the Juſtice then ſaid nothing, nor was ſo kind to give his Advice. But the Juſtice will miſtake the Caſe, he looks upon the Duke as in Poſſeſſion, and not as a Subject; and he looks upon the ſingle Subject, this one Man, to be of more value than all the Subjects Good and Welfare of <hi>England:</hi> and to put a blind upon the World, topes upon us the D's divine Right to be King here over us, and as natural for him to be our King as to do the Office of Nature. Now I always thought the Kingſhip of <hi>England,</hi> as is before hinted, is by the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60490:17"/>Law of the Land, and no otherwiſe, and that every King in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is, or ought to be, the Supream Magiſtrate for the Peoples Good. But if a Prince be born a Fool, an Ideot, or become a mad Man, how can that Man be thought to reign for the Peoples Good? Now if ſuch a thing ſhould happen, may not the King and People, then in being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as in all Ages they have done, chuſe another more fit to govern in that Office? is there any Injuſtice in this? is there any more than common Prudence? and would they be juſt to themſelves if they ſhould do otherwiſe? Where is the Wrong to the mad Man? He is bereaved of his Senſes, muſt therefore the People be ſo too? And in all Ages hath not the Crown of England been ſettled by the King and Parliament? and have not Forreigners done the ſame? witneſs the Portugals, they did not only put by a Subeject, not fit to reign by his Folly, but put by, and do ſtill to this day, their King, when in actual Poſſeſſion, becauſe of his Infirmities other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they had ſinned againſt the very Law of Nature, for that teaches us ſelf Preſervation. But ſo much hath been ſaid already by abler Heads, as to this moſt ridiculous, nonſenſical Notion, that I thought no Man preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to common Senſe, would have dared to have been ſo bold as to have mentioned ſuch a thing, or to arraign the Judgment of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>And now after the Juſtice hath thus ſpent the time in ranting and beating the Air about this unjuſt Deſign of the Parliament; he comes in the next place with his Thunder-bolts to affright and terrify the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and all other thinking Men, from acting according to their own Reaſon. For in the <hi>7th Page</hi> he tells the Jury, <hi>viz. And it could not be expected that the Duke ſhould have ſat ſtill under ſuch in indignity; and if he had, the Prinees of Chriſtendom, to whom he is allied, (and to many of the greateſt) would have taken up the Quarrel, and then our Fields of Peace ſhould have been turned into Fields of Blood; ſo then the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>of which the King is the Head, muſt be afraid to provide for the Safety of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Popery and Ruine, becauſe one of the King's Subjects hath great Friends abroad, and will fight his Quarrel.</hi> Sure ſhould a Phanatick have ſaid but half ſo much, he had been over head and ears in the Crown-Office, and well he might, what, muſt <hi>England</hi> be afraid to do right, and upon one of her own Subjects, becauſe of the Dukes Friends abroad? Certainly <hi>England</hi> was never ſo low and cowardly yet, as to fear to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their own Safety, for fear of the Princes abroad. Pray why did not <hi>Portugal,</hi> conſider that? and why did not the <hi>French</hi> King at firſt ſend and adviſe with the Pope, before he cauſed to be confirmed and regiſtred, as lately, a Rule for the time to come in his Dominions, that the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> was an independent thing from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60490:17"/>that the Pope is not infallible. Doth the Juſtice think, that the King of <hi>France</hi> now did not run as great an hazard of the Pope's and other Princes ill reſenting this, as we ſhould have done in <hi>England,</hi> if we in <hi>England</hi> had ſecured the Nation from a Popiſh Succeſſor. And for the Juſtice telling us, and putting us in mind of the Blood that was ſpilt between the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in their difference about the Crown, it is a moſt ſtrange thing that he hath no more Underſtanding in him, than to compare this of this Parliaments Actings about the Duke, which was the ſenſe of the whole Nation, with that of thoſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> when all Stories tell us that the Nation in thoſe times was divided, and it was doubtful of whoſe ſide the Right was, and here in this Caſe the whole Nation, all of one ſide, would have put the thing all out of doubt by Law, to prevent future Miſchiefs this Parliament did intend; and ſo far are theſe two Caſes different, that the Parliament fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing ſuch Dangers that might ariſe as before, and ſuch bloody times again, that it made them go about to take all poſſible care to prevent it in time to come; and yet you Mr. Juſtice, and the reſt of your Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, are angry with them for it, tho you tell us, we muſt have a care of ſuch Times as were in thoſe Days.</p>
            <p>But now to the proper Work of the Jury; for all this while it is not certainly known what all his former Diſcourſe meant, or whom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed to, therefore now he tells you, it is to acquaint the Jury with the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom, and therein the Statute of the <hi>13th</hi> of this King; which is well done of the Juſtice: And he tells you, <hi>That that Statute provided for the Preſervation of the Kings's Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> So then, it was not made to preſerve the Duke, nor to join him in the Government, that is clear; and if ſo, how ſuitable that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was of his, for doing any ſuch thing as before was hinted, ought to be conſidered. And the Juſtice tells us, <hi>The Statute provides againſt ſetting up of Votes of one or both Houſes of Parliament, to be as effectual as Law.</hi> What the Juſtice means by this, unleſs, as I ſaid before, that he meant the Grand-Jury ſhould preſent the Parliament, is not known; for ſince the King came in, no Parliament ever offered at any ſuch thing; nor can he ſhew any ſuch printed Pamphlets, as he ſpeaks of, walking about our Streets, that do aſſert ſuch a Doctrine, unleſs by ſome of the Juſtices contriving. Therefore he muſt mean, he hates all Votes of Parliament, and them too. And I dare ſay, he would not for a World have any Laws repealed neither, tho never ſo deſtructive to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for if he did mean otherwiſe, he would not quarrel with their Votes, which lead to the repealing of ſuch Laws as are deſtructive to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60490:18"/>common Good. In the next place, where he ſaith, <hi>They have printed Votes to give check to Laws:</hi> Pray what Laws doth he mean? Or did the Parliament ever flie out of their due Bounds? Or is he angry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did repeal the Act <hi>de Heretico comburendo?</hi> Or that the two Houſes had both voted and paſſed the Bill, for the Repeal of the <hi>35th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.?</hi> Or angry with the Parliament, for voting and bringing in Bills for the Repeal of the Laws made againſt the Diſſenters? Sure Sir <hi>W.</hi> who was ſo long in the Penſionary Parliament, muſt needs know, that Votes as well as Debates muſt be in either Houſe, to ſhew their Senſe of what is good for the Nation, and what muſt be had before they can bring it into an Act; and will Sir <hi>W.</hi> quarrel with them for that too? It is really ſomething hard, Sir <hi>W.</hi> that a Man of your Honour ſhould be ſo ſevere upon thoſe Gentlemen, as not only not to give them a good Word behind their Backs, but to compare them to <hi>Nero,</hi> and curſed <hi>Cham,</hi> that uncovered his Father's Nakedneſs; which you do in this Page, unleſs you can better diſcover your own Sence than the Words have ſhewed. And ſurely when you conſider again, you will not call it the ripping open their Mothers Bellies, (that is, the Common-Wealth, as you call it,) for the Parliament to paſs Votes, to repeal ſuch Laws as they think prejudicial to the Life and Preſervation of this Common-Wealth, our Mother, as you term it.</p>
            <p>Now for the good Counſel he gives to the Jury, and for the Cleanneſs of his Hands, Uprightneſs of his Mind, being freed from ambitious Thoughts, his not doing any thing to the Hurt and Prejudice of God, the King, or his Country, and all other his divine Inſinuations, as he in this Page expreſſes, I ſhall wholly leave himſelf to himſelf, only deſire him to examine himſelf by what hath been afore-hinted; and if he find <hi>Ignoramus</hi> there, I ſhall not be much concerned. But ſince the Juſtice warns us from the Word of God, in this page, againſt Perjury and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation, and pronounces the dreadful Sentence of <hi>Ire maledicti</hi> ſo often in his Speech againſt ſuch, he would (methinks) have done well the laſt Summer-Seſſions, as is before hinted, not to have hindred thoſe Bills of Indictment when brought there, being preſented and tendred. But it may be ſince that he hath ſeen his Error, and therefore in this Speech is reſolved, both for the time to come, to amend it himſelf, and alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others; a bleſſed Reformation! if it be really ſo: But if by Craft or Diſſimulation, all this be done to colour what he did before, then the very <hi>Ite maledicti</hi> he pronounces againſt others, may chance to light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Pate; but far is the Author from wiſhing ſuch a ſevere Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the Noble Juſtice, whatever he ſeeks and clandeſtinely wiſhes againſt others.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60490:18"/>
            <p>And now after the Juſtice hath read this Lecture of Chriſtianity, he comes in <hi>pag.</hi> 9. to tell the Court and the Jury of the Rarity and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Thing called <hi>Grand-Juries,</hi> and tells them, <hi>It is the Honour of the Government to have them.</hi> Well then, ſince it is ſo, and that it cannot be denied, it is a great deal of pity, that the Juſtice, and others of his Coat, have not taken more care to preſerve their Reputation, but have ſuffered not only the <hi>Gazette,</hi> but other ſcandalous Libels to walk about the Streets, and defame them, as late Times have moſt notoriouſly ſhown. But this (I conceive) came into his Head by the by, a meer Accident in the Juſtice's Speech; for by what goes before, and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, it appears plain, he did not intend them any Honour, but only had ſome other meaning, as may be eaſily diſcerned, if we compare the Whole of his Diſcourſe, and what he and the reſt of the Juſtices did ſometimes ſince at <hi>Hicks</hi>'s Hall, endeavouring to curtail the Grand-Juries, and to ſtrike out, and put in whom they pleaſed, when there was a Job to do, at the time when the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi> and others, were in the Tower. O then what a Speech was made to the Under-Sheriff to alter his Pannel! and what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Religion was preſs'd to have it done, by this very Juſtice! And if the Sheriff had yielded that Point, then the Subornation had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken effect, and the Work done upon the innocent Priſoners in the Tower, <hi>contra omnes Gentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe Sir <hi>W.</hi> is pleaſed to top upon the World with his Loyalty, and to ſhew it, pretends to extol in this Page the Happineſs of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have by their Prerogative always had the nominating of Sheriffs, by which the Grand Juries are returned: I ſhall crave leave a little to ſpeak to that Point, not that I deny it to be in the King in ſome meaſure, as the Statutes have ſettled it; but the Juſtice miſtakes the Caſe, as will appear, if the thing be well and throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and what this Juſtice aims at, ought alſo to be fully ſearched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but that I may not ſeem to miſconſtrue the Juſtice, I ſhall ſet down his Words in this Page, <hi>viz. Grand Juries have always been eſteemed the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Government, and the great Security of the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects; they are to be</hi> probi &amp; legales Homines, <hi>and ſo is a Golden Chain, as well for Ornament as Security; if they ſhould prove otherwiſe, this Chain of Gold would be turned into Fetters of Iron and Braſs, and we ſhould be greater Slaves here in</hi> England <hi>than they are in</hi> Algier. <hi>Our Anceſtors have taken great Care that Grand Juries ſhould be ſuch as they ought to be, and as you may ſee the Statutes made in that Caſe provide, but for all that, it is happy for the People, that the King hath the Nomination of Sheriffs, by whom
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60490:19"/>the Juries are to be returned, it is a Prerogative of great Conſequence, and not to be entruſted into the hands of any Subject or Subjects whatſoever.</hi> Now as to his Commendation of the Conſtitution of the Government relating to Juries, as being a ſacred thing, there is no doubt of that, and we hope it will never be in his Power, or in the Power of any Judg, Juſtice, or Magiſtrate in <hi>England</hi> to alter that Fundamental Conſtitu ion which our wiſe Anceſtors have laid, that make us both a free and ſafe People; for by that means to ambitious or fooliſh Prince, tho led away by Court-Flatterers, and pernicious Counſels can hurt the Subject, ſo powerfully as otherwiſe they might do; every Man's Life and Eſtate here by this means are ſafe, and cannot be touched or taken from him, but by he Approbation and Conſent of his Peers, and they muſt be of the Vicinage, and <hi>probi &amp; legales Homines,</hi> as the Juſtice obſerves: but becauſe the Juſtice is pleaſed to expreſſe himſelf, or rather to flatter the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> that by their Prerogative they have the ſole right of chuſing of Sheriffs: And that it is the Happineſs of the Nation that the Subject; do it not. I muſt crave leave to put the juſtice in mind of the ancient Practice in that very Caſe of choice of Sheriffs, and alſo ſhow that in all probability the whole Body of the County have been as fit to ſee and chuſe who is fit to ſerve the County in the Office of Sheriffs, as Kings, who do but ſee often times with other Mens Eyes, and hear with other Mens Ears; and often times led by the Noſe of, ſome Perſons about them, as either work their own Ends, or the Ends and Intereſt of their Friends, and not the Countries Good: For who knows not, but that the old ſaying is true in Princes Courts, <hi>Kiſſing goes by Favour.</hi> But to anſwer the Juſtice, I do ſay, and aver from ancient Records, the People of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Shires in <hi>England</hi> had the ſole right of chuſing their Sheriffs without the King's Appointment; Conſent, or Nomination, and that was the Law of the Land; and if it be not now ſo, yet it is but ſome late Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes that have abridged the Counties of their Choice. And to ſhew that I do not miſtake the Point, I have inſerted a new Copy of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which is by me; and that is, a Statute made in the Confirmation of Ancient Right too in the Roll of Parliament, made at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the 28 E. 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. The Title of the Statute is this, <hi>viz. The Inhabitants of every County ſhall make Choice of their Sheriffs, being not of Fee,</hi> the words are theſe,<note place="margin">Rot. 2.28. <hi>E.</hi> 1. An. 1300 Cook <hi>on</hi> Lit. <hi>2d part,</hi> 559.</note> 
               <hi>viz. The King hath granted unto his People, that they ſhall have the Election of their Sheriffs in every Shire where the Sheriffalty is not of Fee, if they liſt.</hi> To this Statute agree our Law-Books: See <hi>Cook's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes;</hi> and this Statute in the ſame Roll, <hi>13th</hi> Chapter is again confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and explained, the Statute begins thus, <hi>viz. And for as much as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60490:19"/>the King hath granted the Election of Sheriffs to the Commons of the Shire; the King will that they ſhall chuſe ſuch Sheriffs that ſhall not charge them, and that they ſhall not put any Officers in Authority for Rewards or Bribes, and ſuch as ſhall not lodg ſo oft in one place, nor with poor Perſons, or Men of Religi n.</hi> Indeed after this in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond's time, Power was given at the Complaint of the Commons in Parliament. That the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor. Treaſurer, Barons of the Ex hequer ſhould appoint the Sheriffs of each County; and how far this laſt abrogates the former Statutes I muſt leave to the judicious Reader. But except the Juſtice can ſhew me ſome other Statute, I cannot ſee how he can make good his Aſſertion of the Right to be in the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by their Prerogative to chuſe Sheriffs, no more than he can make good his own infallibility: And why he ſhould ſtart ſuch a Point with ſo little ground, I cannot imagine, unleſs he was reſolved to put on a <hi>Janus</hi> Face, and intended to row one way when he looked another.</p>
            <p>And now for this Gentleman to pretend to exalt the Prerogative, and to cry out for that, as he doth, and yet at the ſame time lay ſo many falſe Surmiſes, is ſtrange. But I conceive his Deſign is to deſtroy the Law and the Government; or, when he ſpeaks of the Prerogative in general, he intends ſome for himſelf; but if he ſhould, that cannot be altogether ſtrange neither, ſince we know very well both now and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, even in all Ages, Men that are ſet upon their own Luſts and Pleaſures, have been crying up the King's; Prerogative, and damning the Law, only, that thereby they might, under Monarchy, exerciſe a greater Prerogative over their Fellow-Subjects, without any Account to be given to the Law, than the true King doth over his Subjects: for it oftentimes happens, that Perſons in great Command and Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King, do more enſlave the People than the King ever meant or intended, and hide all from the King with this Cheat, that they are Loyal; and whoever is not contented with his domineering, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King by that Flatterer, as the King's great Enemy. And ſo Kings oft-times both live and die blindfold, never ſeeing or hearing any Thing, much leſs any Complaints, but what the Oppreſſor pleaſes: And that undoubtedly muſt not be much; for it muſt be the Courtier's Policy, that hath once dipped himſelf in Roguery, both to hide it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and endeavour to prevent all Perſons elſe from diſcovering it. And this is the true and only Reaſon why theſe Loyal Boys hate and cry down Parliaments; for if they once come, the Court-Knaves are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, every thing then being brought to the Light, and it may be, the King undeceived, and theſe Miſcreants puniſhed.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60490:20"/>
            <p>But Sir <hi>W.</hi> to wind up all, now your Hand is in for Abhorrences, go through-ſtitch, ſet an Abhorrence on Foot for the abhorring of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too, and doubt not but among your Adherers the Project will take, and then you and they are ſafe, without the Devil ſhould cheat you, and a Parliament come when you leaſt think on't; but do not let him cheat you into the belief that there will be no more: you know the Law ſaith, we ought to have it, and the King hath ſaid, we ſhall have Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and that he will govern according to Law; and remember, if it ſhould be yet ſeven Years time before it come, yet it may come too ſoon for your ſtore.</p>
            <p>I have but one Word more to the Juſtices, your Aſſociates, who bring up the Rear of your Speech, they being elevated, and wrapp'd up as it were in the third Heaven, thought it not enough for themſelves to be happy, with the hearing of this profound Diſcourſe, but out of their good Nature, were deſirous to communicate it to the World; and tho it be ſomething ſtrange, that Charges to Grand Juries, ſhould be publiſhed in Print, as they ſeem to allow, when they ſay the reaſon why 'twas publiſh'd, was to prevent Miſrepreſentation, which they had obſerved already from <hi>Janeway</hi>'s Paper; yet it was pitty ſuch a Diſcourſe ſhould be hid in that Grand Jury's Breaſt, to whom it was ſpoken, and therefore the Juſtices order the Printing thereof. And who is to draw up the Order, but their wiſe Clerk of the Peace, who undoubtedly did it, and it may eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be his own, not only from his putting his Name to it, but from its reſembling his former Draught, and Orders about the Conſtables to turn Informers againſt Conventicles. The Order begins thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Ordered by this Court, <hi>That the Charge given in Seſſions by Sir</hi> W. S. <hi>be Printed, and that the Thanks of this Bench be given to Sir</hi> W. S. <hi>for his prudent Care and conſtant Endeavour in the management of Affairs, for the preſervation of the publick Peace, and his Majeſties Government. And this Court doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, they will adhere to Sir</hi> W. S. <hi>and ſtand by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, be it ſo, that the Thanks be given for his prudent Management, and his conſtant Care for the publick Peace, and His Majeſties Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But now, how if Sir <hi>W.</hi> ſhould die, or be put out of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which way then muſt His Majeſties Government be preſerved? truly by this Order it ſeems as if the very Government would be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if not utterly loſt now. How the preſervation of His Majeſties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is upheld, or can be upheld by this ſingle Juſtice alone, ſeems ſtrange, for they ſeem to put it, as if by his prudent Management of Affairs, the Government was upheld; if ſo, I hope His Majeſty will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part with this Knight, for fear of the worſt. Well, but how comes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60490:20"/>it to paſs, that all the reſt of the Juſtices that admire him, have not done the ſame? what do they caſt all the whole burden of the Peace and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, upon one poor Knight's Shoulders, and he but a thin Man neither? for Shame to themſelves, they ſhould not have attributed all to him: but this ſhews them as inſufficient Men, as well as good natur'd to Sir <hi>W.</hi> But by their next Words, <hi>viz. And this Court doth declare they will adhere to Sir</hi> W. S. <hi>and ſtand by him,</hi> &amp;c. If Lives and Fortunes had been put too, then there had been ground for the Whigs to abhorr'd too. What will the Juſtices ſet up Sir <hi>W.</hi> to any thing like Royal Majeſty, or to be chief of the Government, that theſe Gentlemen, called Juſtices, will both adhere to him, and ſtand by him? What can they mean, but to devote themſelves to his Service, inſtead of the Kings? and what can they mean by their ſtanding by him, but in a Warlike Poſture to defend him, when he ſhall command their Service? nor can any rational Man put any other conſtruction on the Words. And ſince that is the conſtruction, what is this but an Aſſociation of the Juſtices to ſet up Sir <hi>W.</hi> inſtead of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or at leaſt to be one of the chief in it? And when they have brought their Ends about, that Sir <hi>W.</hi> is to be exalted, then I doubt not but their Clerk, Mr. <hi>Adderly,</hi> ſhall be Secretary to that great Heroe, where we leave them to careſs themſelves within their own Shadows, until another fit opportunity.</p>
